**Welcome to my Term 2 Lab repository!**




When you enter the repository you can straight away find the files for **my app**.


**Username**: hash
**Password**: hash1234


They include:
- **app.py** : This holds all my python code for my app
- **Templates** : this holds all the HTML and Jinja for my app
- **static** : additional bootstrap CSS classes
- **Vs_URL_FOR** : This allows the app to run on the right server



I decided to create a daily task managing API. The app Uses Flask-bootstrap and Jinja to render the templates and the bootstrap. It also uses Flask-SQLAlchemy to design the tables and connect to the database. It was really helpfull using SQLAlchemy as it allowed me to run queries quite easily.

I also used Flask-login and Flask-WTForm to create a login/signup for my app and used the WTForm to validate my forms. I used the 'Sha256' algorithm to hash my passwords and store them into the database to add extra security.

I started from a basic flask app and tried to implement many different frameworks into the app.


The other sub directories contain  different labs.

**other**: contains the early lab work such as RSSFEED.py and Contains lab-13/lab-14.

**mytwits**: Contains labs 15&16. This is a working mytwits app.

**mytwitsapi**: Contains lab 17 where we had to implement a API into our twits app.

**SQLAlchemy**: This contains lab 18 where we had to use Flask-Alchemy into our twits app.

**Blueprints**: This contains lab 20 where we had to use Blueprints in our twits app.

Majority of the lab work is my own code with my own names but eventually produces the same results as the labs mainly because some code was taken from the repository.
